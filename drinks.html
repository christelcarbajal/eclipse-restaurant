                        Tall, refreshing and bluer than the bluest Caribbean sky, the cocktail turns vodka, blue curaçao
                        and
                        lemonade into a drink you will want to dive into.</i>

                    <i>
                        With a brilliant pink color and tangy, it has a refreshing flavor. This great cocktail is ready
                        to
                        spice up your next gathering, be it a dinner
                        party or drinks on the patio with friends.
                        It was at its height in the 1990’s (hello, Sex and the
                        City) and sometimes makes purists roll their eyes. BUT! The Cosmo is a legit sour cocktail
                        that’s
                        worth drinking: the beautiful color is reason in itself.</i>

                    <i>
                    The Mojito is one of the most popular rum cocktails served today, with a recipe known around the
                    world. The origins of this classic drink can be traced to Cuba and the 16th-century cocktail El
                    Draque. Named for Sir Francis Drake, the English sea captain and explorer who visited Havana in
                    1586, El Draque was composed of aguardiente (a cane-spirit precursor to rum), lime, mint and sugar.
                    It was supposedly consumed for medicinal purposes, but it’s easy to believe that drinkers enjoyed
                    its flavor and effects.</i>
